A generic console application with some \char`\"{}imitation\char`\"{} classes of otherwise typical C++ objects, which print all of their functions to the terminal window, reporting such details as their memory address, size in bytes, which constructor they are created from (default, initialized, copy or move constructed, etc) and other useful information. Ideal for testing algorithms at a rudimentary/fundamental level, for example to check if (and where) new memory allocations are happening within your test code -\/ very interesting when constructing or even when simply adding one value to another... -\/ and keeping track of the size and line-\/for-\/line performance of your test code.

{\itshape Please note; if this app/code is any interest to you in it\textquotesingle{}s presently very unfinished state, then you may want to clone now and keep an eye on it over time (why not hit \char`\"{}follow\char`\"{}) as this codebase and it\textquotesingle{}s functions is likely to change and expand, possibly quite a bit, as I progress with it. Especially if any cool feedback or collaborative opportunities arise!}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Before we begin...}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

The initial idea was to make a class in it\textquotesingle{}s own header file which simply wraps an in-\/built type (floats, doubles, etc) with all of it\textquotesingle{}s possible operators being overloaded to report all operations to the terminal. Being predominantly a self-\/learner of C++ myself, this turned out to be incredibly eye-\/opening, beyond my expectations. I decided to share alike in the spirit of helping other self-\/learners to enable themeselves to level up a bit -\/ let\textquotesingle{}s face it, C++ is an advanced and deep language; in my experience, it can be extremely frustrating trying to find concise, digestable answers to some basic, fundamental questions about how C++ works, and how to work with it, even regarding the basic bread-\/and-\/butter operators such as \char`\"{}+=\char`\"{} vs. \char`\"{}+\char`\"{}... and sometimes, all you really need is to help yourself out a little bit by digging in and getting your hands dirty in the code.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{How to use it?}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Grab the Console\+Application directory, and open \char`\"{}\+Console\+Application.\+cpp\char`\"{} in your favourite IDE. Hit \char`\"{}run and debug\char`\"{}, or similar. Whichever algorithms I\textquotesingle{}ve been testing most lately should run in the console; hit \char`\"{}enter\char`\"{} when prompted (by the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacestoneydsp_a371ebe518736f366be7ba00d1714e18d}{end\+Function()}} method calls in the code block), to advance to the next step. The console terminal will report exactly what is being constructed, how, and where to/where from (if copying/moving a value, for example) and all basic operators shall do likewise. Erase my code from the \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp_adedb285b02c41bde2158ded9cc9fd7ac}{main()}} function and start building your test-\/code using the classes I\textquotesingle{}ve added as header files in place of your usual primitive types and objects. And of course, go ahead and begin making your own readout reports and custom types as you see fit. With the provided classes, you can do things like initialize a new value, add it to an existing value, and observe whether you are simply adding two values together, or actually constructing a whole new one, using it\textquotesingle{}s value, then destroying it (demo below)... not to mention, to check the size on disk for each object along the way, or the memory location you are calling to/from. Many ways to catch what the compiler is really doing with your instructions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{But, why?}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Did you know that an empty class with only a constructor takes one byte in memory? Or that if you give that class a data member (like a float), it has the exact same size on disk as that member? How about constructing a float with an initial value equal to Pi... this \char`\"{}temporary\char`\"{} numerical Pi value actually has it\textquotesingle{}s own memory address and size, as reported to the console. Construct a second float also with an initial value of Pi... and it will call this Pi from the exact same memory address as the first float did! Then construct a third float with an initial value of, say, 2.\+0F... which we can now see is called from the same memory address where Pi previously was! Hmm, could this be a clue to a neat hidden compiler optimization? With this knowledge, would it be more appropriate to instantiate our Pi value somewhere in memory, so that we may explicitly handle it\textquotesingle{}s assignment to 2.\+0F, and possibly even destroy it once we\textquotesingle{}re done?

How about we try adding two of our floats together... Just how much difference is there in using the \char`\"{}+=\char`\"{} operator, compared to the \char`\"{}+\char`\"{} operator? How much difference does that one additional keystroke really make to our code performance, under the hood? This testbed won\textquotesingle{}t report the exact machine instructions (your IDE should be capable of going that deep), but it WILL print all assignments, allocations, constructions, destructions and other very interesting info to the console.... in plain English \+:)\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Ok, show me?}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
At time of writing, there are a few parts currently in flux while I finalize them. For the moment, take a look at \char`\"{}\+Float.\+h\char`\"{} which overloads almost every possible operator to report itself to the console. In the Console\+App.\+cpp, try calling a new float value named \char`\"{}a\char`\"{}. Where usually we would write\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}int main()
{
    float a;
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To use the test version of floats which reports it\textquotesingle{}s activity to the console, just capitalize the first value -\/ this will call the class I\textquotesingle{}ve built in \char`\"{}\+Float.\+h\char`\"{} -\/ just a simple wrapper around a standard float. \begin{DoxyVerb}int main()
{
    Float a;
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Terminal output of the above (may change with future revisions)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}00BCF760 - class Float - Called Default Constructor!

As we can see, we constructed a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} using it\textquotesingle{}s default constructor (since no values were passed in during creation). The class has a member with size of a float, at the same address as the class itself. Single responsibility principle.

Let\textquotesingle{}s build that \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} again, but this time with an initial value of Pi\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}int main()

 See how we called the Initialized Constructor this time, since we assigned a value to instantiate with? Cool. For our next \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}}, it shall be initialized to the value of the previous \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} (which we named \char`\"{}a\char`\"{} in our previous example) using the \char`\"{}copy assignment\char`\"{} (or \char`\"{}=\char`\"{}) operator\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}int main()

Wow! Wait... what?

Let\textquotesingle{}s break this one down\+:

So first, a whole new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} object got created via it\textquotesingle{}s Copy Constructor, and given an initial value of Pi. The \char`\"{}addition allocation\char`\"{} (\char`\"{}+\char`\"{}) operator then operates on it\textquotesingle{}s value, and here in this new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} object is stored the result of our arithmetic.

That \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} object is then used to call a Move Constructor at a new memory address -\/ this is our new \char`\"{}\+Float c\char`\"{} coming to life -\/ and then once this Move Constructor is complete, the result from the \char`\"{}+\char`\"{} operator that got Copy-\/\+Constructed into a whole new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} is simply destroyed!

If that blurb doesn\textquotesingle{}t quite make an easy read, I suggest having a look at the memory addresses in the above output and keeping an eye on what is happening and where.

Now, what if we try the same thing, with the \char`\"{}addition assignment\char`\"{} operator (\char`\"{}+=\char`\"{})? \begin{DoxyVerb}int main()
{
    Float a = 3.14159F; // see previous example

    Float b = a; // see previous example

    Float c = a + b; // see previous example

    Float d = a += b;
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Terminal output for \char`\"{}\+Float d = a += b\char`\"{}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}008FF8B8 - class Float - Called Addition Assignment Operator [+=] with address 008FF8B4 = 3.14159
008FF8B8 - class Float - 3.14159 += 3.14159 = 6.28318

Much better -\/ no unneccesary nested function calls. No unneccessary allocations \+:)

What about when our \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp_adedb285b02c41bde2158ded9cc9fd7ac}{main()}} function goes out of scope? Everything gets destroyed (in reverse order), but what are the final values? \begin{DoxyVerb}008FF8B8 - class Float - Called Destructor!

008FF8B8 - class Float = 6.28318

 Interesting... our very first \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} object (destroyed last) is holding the value of double Pi at the time of it\textquotesingle{}s destruction. That\textquotesingle{}s because of the \char`\"{}addition assignment\char`\"{} operator we\textquotesingle{}d called on it earlier.

And as for our actual test code itself... would we rather have that whole new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} object copy-\/constructed, but under it\textquotesingle{}s own identifier where we can control it (including it\textquotesingle{}s wanton destruction) directly, so that our original variable is un-\/changed?\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Not sure... you tell me?}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Nah. That will depend entirely on your needs, your purposes, your code.

This simple application is just a method of informing {\itshape oneself} of the \char`\"{}best\char`\"{}, or rather most appropriate way to construct one\textquotesingle{}s intended code.

Let\textquotesingle{}s say you come across some code from some other environment, say, Mat\+Lab or a script-\/based language, that looks like this (it happens!); \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    Float a = 3.14159F;

    Float b = a;

    Float c = a + b;

    Float d = a += b;

    Float e = a / b + c * c - d;

    return e;
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 What would be the most sane way to derive the value for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}} \char`\"{}e\char`\"{} in the above, using C++?\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{That Console Terminal might help guide us on operator precedence in this case?}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
Exactly.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{What\textquotesingle{}s next?}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
Now, as of time of writing, I\textquotesingle{}ve been working on a base class called \char`\"{}\+Value\char`\"{} (in it\textquotesingle{}s own header file, if you want to check it) -\/ this CAN be called directly, but instead, I\textquotesingle{}m building child classes (check \char`\"{}\+Double\char`\"{}) which derive several of their operator functions from the parent \char`\"{}\+Value\char`\"{}, and implement others of their own. Eventually I\textquotesingle{}ll have all basic types -\/ Int, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_float}{Float}}, Double, Bool etc -\/ deriving common operator functions from Value, while implementing their own type-\/specific operators, like bitshifts and boolean comparisons, at child-\/class level.

I was highly frustrated trying to understand why the parent \char`\"{}\+Value\char`\"{} class would be constructed with an initial size of 4 bytes + it\textquotesingle{}s member(s), instead of 1 byte like an empty class does. Turns out, \char`\"{}virtual\char`\"{} functions cause some kind of allocation at the base class level. Not currently sure if this is only when overriding in the child class, or some other reason... (note from future self\+: the answer is vtables)

But these are the kind of tools that will lead to answers for the inquisitive self-\/learner \+:)\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Before you go...}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
